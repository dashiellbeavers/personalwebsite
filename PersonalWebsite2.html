    <p> Dash loves football. He is often found playing football with his friends during his frees behind Bergen County Academies. He loves Fantasy Footballâ€”he is 7 leagues this season. He also watches football every Monday, Sunday, and Thursday. This is a photo of Dash on the MegaTron at a New York Football Giants Game, his favorite team.</p>

    <p>If you are a football fan and you are not a Giants fan, don't worry. Dash will help you. All it takes is one <a href="https://www.giants.com" title="New York Giants" target="_blank">click.</a></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Dash looks forward to seeing the Giants win yet <strong><u>another</u></strong> Super Bowl, which they seem to do a lot. This includes two wins in the 21st century.</p>
        <ul class="em">
            <li>2008 against the undefeated New England Patriots</li>
            <li>2012 against the New England Patriots</li>
        </ul>

<p>Dash is interested in being in the sports business. He thinks its a perfect mesh of his skills and love.</p>
